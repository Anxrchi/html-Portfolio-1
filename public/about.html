<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Caitlin Lombaard! Based in South Africa, and I am currently a student. <br /> 
  I have experience in minor coding, matriculating with an A in Computers Application Technology as well as a history in art with a Higher Certificate in Design Thinking. 
  I am currently furthering my knowledge and studying Web Development. 
  I have an immense passion for art and a big appreciation for technology, and strive to brake into an industry that combines the best of both.

  I firmly believe one of humanities greatest joys is learning. 
  That is why I describe myself as an individual that is constantly learning and trying something different. Trail and error is an old buddy who knows me by name, and problem solving is our favourite game. <br />
  Most often i won't step back from a task until it's finished, but i'm learning to to take my time with the things that truly matter; wether it's a big project that requires a fresh and focused mind or a handmade gift for my loved ones.

  My ultimate goal is to work towards a brighter future, doing something that fullfils me and aids others, even if it's just something as simple as a hasle free website.<br />
  It definetly won't hurt if that "something" looks extra pretty too.
