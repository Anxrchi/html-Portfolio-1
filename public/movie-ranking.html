    <h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
    <p>
        I like the different dragon designs; their overall look and abilities. The worldbuilding is fascinating, the plot really hit the feels as well and it's a movie that always remind me of my childhood.<br /> 
        What can I say? I'm a sucker for nostalgia.

    <h3>KungFu Panda</h3>
    <p>
        Again I really like the different animal designs, how they incorperated the original culture and the musical influence. The art direction was phenomenal in my humble opinion<br />
        The plot was also very inspiring with important themes linking to our daily life. These are movies done right.

    <h3>Night At The Museum</h3>
    <P>
        Come on now...The movie speaks for itself. <br />
        There won't be a second of boredom watching this. Very interesting with fascinating takes on historical figures. While comedic it has a serious undertone with unexpected moments of frailty and strenght. <br />
        Maybe I'm biased, but it's a 10/10.
